# HomeGlow Documentation

Welcome to the HomeGlow developer documentation. This directory is the starting
point for anyone evaluating the project or preparing to contribute. It describes
what HomeGlow is **in its current state**, how the pieces fit together, and how
to get productive quickly.

Please be sure to update these docs as changes are made to ensure the information
stays relevant.

> **HomeGlow** is an open-source, self-hosted dashboard for touch-enabled home
> displays (think Magic Mirror), built as a React SPA frontend and a Fastify +
> SQLite backend, shipped as two Docker images.

## 🔑 Facts worth knowing before you dive in

- **Two deployable units**: `homeglow-frontend` (Nginx serving the built SPA and
  proxying `/api`) and `homeglow-backend` (Fastify). They talk over a Docker
  network; the browser only ever talks to the frontend.
- **No user accounts / auth**: the app has no login. The only access control is an
  optional PIN on the Admin Panel. Do not expose it to the public internet.
- **Per-device configuration**: each browser generates a random device name
  (stored in `localStorage`) and its own tabs, layout, and widget settings live
  server-side keyed by that device name.
- **SQLite is the single source of truth** for chores, users, calendars, photos,
  settings, tabs, and layouts. The DB file lives at `server/data/tasks.db`.
- **The backend is one big file** — [`server/index.js`](../server/index.js). Route
  groups are documented in the [Backend Reference](reference/backend-api.md).
