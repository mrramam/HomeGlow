# Database & Migrations

HomeGlow stores everything in a single **SQLite** database accessed synchronously
through **better-sqlite3**. This page documents the schema as it exists today and
the migration system that produces it.

- **File location:** `server/data/tasks.db` (override with `DB_PATH`).
- **Access layer:** all queries are prepared statements in
  [`server/index.js`](../../server/index.js) and the `services/` modules.
- **Foreign keys:** enabled at connection time (`PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`).

## Migration system

There are **two tiers** of migrations, both run at server startup in
[`server/index.js`](../../server/index.js) (`start()` → `runLegacyMigrations()` /
`applySchemaMigrations()`).

### 1. Legacy bootstrap migrations (idempotent)
Run only on a fresh database (detected by the absence of the `settings` table).
They create the original tables and perform one-off data reshaping:

| Module | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`initializeDatabase.js`](../../server/migrations/initializeDatabase.js) | Creates the base tables (`chores`, `users`, `events`, `settings`, `prizes`, `calendar_sources`, `photo_sources`, `admin_pin`, and the original `tabs`/`widget_tab_assignments`). Seeds the `bonus` user (id 0). |
| [`migrateChoresDatabase.js`](../../server/migrations/migrateChoresDatabase.js) | Introduces the three-table chore model (`chore_schedules`, `chore_history`) and converts old repeat types to cron expressions. |
| [`migrateClamsToHistory.js`](../../server/migrations/migrateClamsToHistory.js) | Moves the denormalized clam total off `users` into `chore_history` rows. |
| [`migrateChoreHistoryTitle.js`](../../server/migrations/migrateChoreHistoryTitle.js) | Backfills chore title info on history rows. |
| [`migrateToDurationField.js`](../../server/migrations/migrateToDurationField.js) | Adds the `duration` concept to schedules. |

### 2. Numbered schema migrations (versioned)
The current version is stored in `settings` under the key `SYSTEM_SCHEMA_ID`.
On startup, every migration whose `schemaId` is greater than the stored value is
run in ascending order. The registry lives in `schemaMigrations` in
[`server/index.js`](../../server/index.js):

| schemaId | Module | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | `migrateDeviceSchemaV6.js` | Rebuilds `devices`, `tabs`, `widget_tab_assignments` around a **device-name** model (per-display config). |
| 7 | `schema7-proveMigrations.js` | No-op/marker to prove the versioned migration runner works. |
| 8 | `schema8-calendarCacheTables.js` | Adds `calendar_events_cache` and `calendar_sync_status`. |
| 9 | `schema9-googleConnection.js` | Adds `google_accounts` and `google_oauth_states` (OAuth). |
| 10 | `schema10-googlePhotosPicker.js` | Adds `google_picked_media` and picker-session columns on `photo_sources`. |
| 11 | `schema11-homeglowPhotos.js` | Adds `homeglow_photos` (locally uploaded photos). |
| 12 | `schema12-onceCompletedScheduling.js` | Adds `interval` and `parent_schedule_id` columns to `chore_schedules`. |
| 13 | `schema13-tabsByDefaultBackfill.js` | Backfills default tabs. |
| 14 | `schema14-deviceAndTabJsonStorage.js` | Moves widget layout into `tabs.config_json` and device settings into `devices.device_settings_json`; **drops** `widget_tab_assignments`. |
| 15 | `schema15-choreDueTimeSound.js` | Adds `due_time`, `sound`, `sound_enabled`, `reminder_interval_minutes` to `chore_schedules` (chore due-time notification sounds). |
| 16 | `schema16-choreDueDate.js` | Adds `due_date` to `chore_schedules` (calendar deadline with urgency coloring, issue #97). |
| 17 | `schema17-choreTransferSnooze.js` | Adds `transferable`, `can_snooze`, `snoozed_until`, `transfer_bonus_clams` to `chore_schedules` (dashboard long-press transfer/snooze, issue #122). |
| 18 | `schema18-pluginsTable.js` | Adds the `plugins` table (DB-backed plugin store, issue #105 Phase 0) and imports any on-disk `widgets/*.html` + `widgets_registry.json` entries. |
| 19 | `schema19-pluginStorage.js` | Adds the `plugin_storage` table (namespaced KV store for manifest plugins, issue #105 Phase 1). |
| 20 | `schema20-choreHistoryKind.js` | Adds `chore_history.kind` (`completion`/`daily_bonus`/`transfer_bonus`/`adjustment`/`missed`/`spent`) with magic-string backfill + a partial unique index for idempotent missed-chore logging (issue #72). |
| 21 | `schema21-prizeOffers.js` | Adds `prize_offers` (the prize store: one-time redeemable instances of ledger prizes with the available → requested → redeemed request queue). |
| 22 | `schema22-prizeRepeatSplit.js` | Adds `prizes.repeatable` (approval returns the offer to the shelf instead of consuming it) and `prize_offers.split_user_ids` (co-spenders sharing the cost evenly). |
| 23 | `schema23-userSortOrder.js` | Adds `users.sort_order` (admin-chosen display order, issue #134), backfilled from `id` so existing households keep their current order. |
| 24 | `schema24-choreIcon.js` | Adds `chores.icon` — an optional emoji shown on the dashboard card (issue #141). Stored as the literal character rather than a name, so the picker's bank can grow without a migration. NULL means no icon. |
| 25 | `schema25-unifyCredentialEncryption.js` | Re-encrypts `calendar_sources.password` and `photo_sources.api_key`/`password`/`refresh_token` from the old AES-256-CBC scheme (which fell back to a key hardcoded in the repo) onto the auto-keyed AES-256-GCM store the rest of the app uses. Skips values already converted, so a replay is a no-op; a row that cannot be decrypted is logged by name and left rather than aborting the batch. |
| 26 | `schema26-googleScopeSets.js` | Adds `google_oauth_states.service` — the comma-separated scope-set keys (`calendar`, `photos`) requested for that authorization. Carries the user's choice across the OAuth round trip so the callback records what was actually asked for rather than assuming every scope was granted. `NOT NULL DEFAULT 'calendar,photos'`, so rows written by an older build read back as the full set. |

Each versioned migration runs inside a transaction, reads its context from
`globalThis.__HOMEGLOW_SCHEMA_MIGRATION_CONTEXT`, and writes the new
`SYSTEM_SCHEMA_ID` before committing. Use
[`migrationTemplate.js`](../../server/migrations/migrationTemplate.js) as a
starting point — see [Contributing → adding a migration](../guides/contributing.md#adding-a-database-migration).

## Current schema (post-migration state)

> Note: because of migration 14, **`widget_tab_assignments` no longer exists** in
> new databases — widget layout is stored as JSON inside `tabs.config_json`. The
> API still exposes "widget-assignments" endpoints, but they read/write that JSON.

### Chores domain

**`chores`** — the definition of a task.
```
id, user_id, title, description, time_period, assigned_day_of_week,
repeat_type, completed, clam_value (default 0), expiration_date
```

**`chore_schedules`** — when/for whom a chore recurs.
```
id, chore_id ─▶ chores(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
user_id (nullable = unassigned / bonus pool),
crontab (NULL = one-time instance),
duration ('day-of' | 'until-completed' | 'once-completed'),
interval (e.g. '3m', '1w' for recurring sticky chores),
parent_schedule_id ─▶ chore_schedules(id),   -- links generated instances to their recurring parent
due_time,                     -- 'HH:MM' 24h local time the chore is due (nullable)
sound_enabled,                -- 0/1: play a notification sound at due_time
sound,                        -- chosen sound filename; null = use global default
reminder_interval_minutes,    -- null/0 = ring once; N = repeat every N min until completed
due_date,                     -- 'YYYY-MM-DD' calendar deadline (nullable; drives yellow/red urgency, #97)
visible, created_at
```

**`chore_history`** — completion / clam ledger (source of truth for balances;
a balance is always `SUM(clam_value)` for the user).
```
id, user_id, chore_schedule_id ─▶ chore_schedules(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
date,          -- local 'YYYY-MM-DD'
clam_value,    -- negative for kind='spent' rows (non-destructive spending, #72)
title,
kind,          -- completion | daily_bonus | transfer_bonus | adjustment | missed | spent
created_at     -- UTC; use `date` for day bucketing
```
The nightly job logs `kind='missed'` rows (clam_value 0) for due-but-uncompleted
regular chores, and spending inserts negative `kind='spent'` rows instead of
deleting earned history — so metrics never shrink retroactively.

### Users, prizes, settings

**`users`** — family members. Row `id = 0` is the seeded `bonus` pseudo-user.
`sort_order` is the admin-chosen display order (issue #134): every read goes
through `ORDER BY sort_order, id`, so the dashboard columns, assignment
dropdowns, and transfer/split pickers all follow it. New users append at the
end; the `bonus` row keeps `sort_order` 0 and stays pinned first.
```
id, username, email, profile_picture, sort_order
```

**`prizes`** — the prize definitions ledger (kept forever in Prize Management).
`repeatable` prizes stay on the store shelf after each redemption instead of
being consumed.
```
id, name, clam_cost, repeatable (0|1)
```

**`prize_offers`** — the prize store: redeemable instances of ledger
prizes, mirroring the chores/chore_schedules split. Request queue: a kid
requests on the kiosk; a parent approves (PIN-gated when set) → clams deducted
as negative `kind='spent'` history rows titled with the prize name, offer
consumed (or returned to the shelf if the prize is repeatable),
`prize.redeemed` event fires (kiosk confetti celebration). A request may name
co-spenders (`split_user_ids`, JSON array excluding the requester); each
participant then pays `floor(cost / participants)` and the remainder of an
uneven split is silently discounted.
```
id, prize_id ─▶ prizes(id) CASCADE,
status ('available' | 'requested' | 'redeemed'),
requested_by ─▶ users(id) SET NULL, requested_at, redeemed_at, created_at,
split_user_ids (JSON array of co-spender user ids, NULL when solo)
```

**`settings`** — global key/value store (API keys, `SYSTEM_SCHEMA_ID`, migration
flags; also household-scoped plugin settings under `plugin:<pluginId>:settings`,
issue #105 Phase 2).
```
key (PK), value
```

**`admin_pin`** — single-row optional PIN hash for the Admin Panel.
```
id (=1), pin_hash, created_at, updated_at
```

### Devices, tabs & layout (per-display config)

**`devices`** — one row per browser/display (name is the `localStorage` UUID).
```
id, name (UNIQUE), updateTime, device_settings_json  -- JSON blob of widget/plugin/theme settings
```

**`tabs`** — dashboard tabs for a device.
```
id, device_name ─▶ devices(name) CASCADE, number, label, icon, show_label,
created_at, config_json  -- JSON: { widgetName: {layout_x, layout_y, layout_w, layout_h} }
```

### Plugins (custom widgets)

**`plugins`** — DB-backed plugin store (issue #105 Phase 0). Widget HTML lives
here — not on the container filesystem — so installed plugins survive image
upgrades. `plugin_id`/`manifest_json` are reserved for manifest plugins
(issue #105 Phase 1) and are NULL for plain HTML widgets.
```
id, plugin_id (UNIQUE, nullable), filename (UNIQUE), name,
content,               -- the widget HTML, served at /widgets/:filename
manifest_json,         -- parsed embedded plugin manifest; NULL for legacy widgets
source ('upload' | 'github'), original_url, installed_at, updated_at
```

**`plugin_storage`** — namespaced key/value documents for manifest plugins that
declare `"storage": true` (issue #105 Phase 1). Accessed via
`/api/plugin/v1/storage/:pluginId/...`; capped at 64 KB per value, 500 keys per
plugin.
```
id, plugin_id, key, value_json, updated_at
UNIQUE(plugin_id, key)
```

### Calendar

**`calendar_sources`** — configured calendars (ICS, CalDAV, Google).
```
id, name, type, url, username, password (encrypted), color, enabled, sort_order, created_at
```

**`calendar_events_cache`** — synced events (populated by the sync service).
```
id, source_id ─▶ calendar_sources(id) CASCADE, event_uid, title,
start_time, end_time, description, location, all_day, raw_data, created_at
UNIQUE(source_id, event_uid, start_time)
```

**`calendar_sync_status`** — per-source sync bookkeeping.
```
source_id (PK) ─▶ calendar_sources(id) CASCADE, last_sync_at, last_sync_status,
last_sync_message, event_count, sync_interval_minutes (default 15)
```

### Photos

**`photo_sources`** — configured photo providers (Immich, Google Photos, HomeGlow upload).
```
id, name, type, url, api_key, username, password, album_id, refresh_token,
enabled, sort_order, created_at, picker_session_id, picker_session_expire
```

**`google_picked_media`** — media chosen via the Google Photos Picker and downloaded locally.
```
id, source_id ─▶ photo_sources(id) CASCADE, google_media_id, filename,
mime_type, local_path, width, height, created_time, downloaded_at
UNIQUE(source_id, google_media_id)
```

**`homeglow_photos`** — photos uploaded directly to HomeGlow.
```
id, source_id ─▶ photo_sources(id) CASCADE, filename, original_name,
mime_type, size, uploaded_at
```

### Google integration

**`google_accounts`** — linked Google account with encrypted OAuth tokens.
```
id, google_sub (UNIQUE), email, name, picture,
access_token_enc, refresh_token_enc, token_expiry, scopes, created_at, updated_at
```

**`google_oauth_states`** — short-lived OAuth CSRF/state records.
```
state (PK), redirect_uri, return_url, created_at
```

### Legacy / misc

**`events`** — original events table from the very first schema; retained but
superseded by the calendar cache.

## Encryption of stored credentials

Sensitive fields (CalDAV passwords, Google tokens) are encrypted with
**AES-256-CBC** before being written to SQLite:

- Helpers `encryptPassword` / `decryptPassword` live in
  [`server/index.js`](../../server/index.js); newer connection code uses
  [`server/utils/encryption.js`](../../server/utils/encryption.js).
- The key comes from `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (must be a stable 32-byte key). If it is
  missing/invalid, third-party connections (Google, etc.) are disabled and the
  server logs a warning at startup. See [Configuration](../reference/configuration.md).

## Backups

To back up, copy the two bind-mounted directories while the container is stopped
(or accept a live copy):

- `./homeglow/data/` — the SQLite database.
- `./homeglow/uploads/` — user avatars, uploaded photos, and widget files.
