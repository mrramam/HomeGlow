# Features & Domains

This page explains HomeGlow's user-facing feature areas and how each maps onto the
code, so you know where to look when working on a given domain.

## Dashboard, tabs & layout

- Each **device** (browser) has its own set of **tabs** and, per tab, a widget
  **layout** (which widgets, and their x/y/w/h in a 12-column grid).
- Layout editing is toggled by the **lock** control in the `TabBar`. Unlocked, you
  can drag widgets and resize them with edge +/- buttons.
- Layout is persisted to the backend via the `widget-assignments/layout` endpoints,
  which store it inside `tabs.config_json` (see [Database](../architecture/database.md)).
- **Tab order** is managed in Admin → Widgets → Tabs: up/down arrows (the only
  control that works on touch, since HTML5 drag events never fire there) plus
  row dragging on desktop. Home is fixed at position 1. Both paths post the
  full desired order to `PATCH /api/devices/:deviceName/tabs/reorder`.
- **Copy a device**: `POST /api/devices/:deviceName/copy-from/:sourceDeviceName`
  duplicates tabs + settings — handy for provisioning a new display like an existing one.

**Code:** `WidgetContainer.jsx`, `DraggableWidget.jsx`, `TabBar.jsx`,
`TabIconModal.jsx`, and the `widgets` memo in `app.jsx`.

## Theming (light / dark / auto)

- Three modes: **light**, **dark**, and **auto** (follows local sunrise/sunset,
  computed from a configured location — no API key or weather provider needed).
- Implemented with CSS variables in `index.css` and a `data-theme` attribute on
  `<html>`. Gradients and interface colors are configurable in the Admin Panel and
  pushed to CSS variables at runtime.
- Preferences persist in `localStorage` (`theme`, `themeMode`, `interfaceColors`).

**Code:** theme logic in `app.jsx`, colors in `index.css`,
`ColorPickerPopover.jsx`, `colorContrast.js`.

## Chores & the clam reward system

The chore system uses a **three-table model** (see [Database](../architecture/database.md)):
`chores` (definitions) → `chore_schedules` (recurrence + assignment) →
`chore_history` (completion/clam ledger).

- **Recurrence** is expressed as cron (`crontab`). A `NULL` crontab means a
  one-time instance.
- **Duration** controls persistence:
  - `day-of` — shows only on the scheduled day.
  - `until-completed` — a "sticky" chore that stays until done.
  - `once-completed` — sticky, and recurs again after an `interval` (e.g. `3m`).
- **Sticky chores** are materialized nightly: the background job creates one-time
  child schedules (`parent_schedule_id`) when a recurring sticky schedule fires.
- **Clams** are a reward currency earned by completing chores; balances are derived
  by summing `chore_history` (no denormalized total). Completing *all* of a user's
  daily chores awards a bonus. **Bonus chores** carry a custom clam value and reset
  to unassigned each night; only one uncompleted bonus chore per user at a time.
- **Chore icons** (issue #141): a chore can carry an optional emoji, picked from
  a grouped bank when creating or editing it. On the dashboard the icon **takes
  the place of the checkmark** while the chore is pending, and reverts to the
  usual undo arrow once done — so it costs no horizontal space in a per-user
  column that is only 180–250px wide. Chores without an icon keep the checkmark.
  The icon belongs to the chore, so every schedule of it shows the same picture.
- **All-chores-done celebration** (issue #140): when a user finishes their last
  regular chore, **confetti pops up from the bottom of the screen** and a chime
  plays — the same popcorn physics as the vacation screensaver. Deliberately
  wordless and names nobody: the panel turning green and the clam total already
  say who and what. It draws no backdrop and never intercepts a tap, so the
  dashboard stays usable while it plays. Distinct from the prize celebration,
  which is a centred card with falling confetti.
  - **Two triggers, deduplicated.** The display that completed the chore reacts
    to its own local state, so it needs nothing from the network beyond the
    completion request that just succeeded. The `chore.allCompleted` SSE event
    is what lets *other* displays in the house join in. It originally relied on
    the event alone, which made the whole feature hostage to the event stream
    surviving a deployment's reverse proxy — everything else shown on completion
    is computed locally, so a blocked stream made the celebration the one thing
    that silently did nothing.
  - Fires once per user per day, from whichever route emptied the list —
    completing, receiving a transfer, or snoozing the last chore out of today.
    Undoing the last chore revokes the daily bonus, so redoing it celebrates again.
  - Toggle in **Admin Panel → Chores → Settings** (on by default); it is a
    display preference, so the event still reaches plugins when it is off.
  - Skipped entirely under `prefers-reduced-motion` — the effect is nothing but
    motion, so there is no meaningful reduced version.
- **The prize store** (spending mechanism): `prizes` is the definitions ledger
  in Prize Management; parents stock the store with offers (`prize_offers`).
  Kids browse the 🛍️ Prize Store on the dashboard and **request** an offer;
  a parent **approves or declines** right there (PIN-gated when a PIN is set).
  Approval deducts the cost as a named `spent` ledger row, consumes the offer
  (the definition stays in management), and fires a **full-screen confetti
  celebration + chime** on every display via the `prize.redeemed` event.
  - **Repeatable prizes** (a toggle on the definition, shown as 🔁): approval
    returns the offer to the shelf instead of consuming it, for prizes like
    "movie night" that can be redeemed again and again.
  - **Cost splitting**: kids sharing a prize pick "👥 Split cost" and select
    who's in; each participant pays an even `floor(cost / N)` share (the odd
    remainder is silently discounted) and the celebration names everyone.
- **Avatar quick-spend**: tapping a kid's profile picture opens "Redeem clams" —
  a parent records off-store spending (e.g. a toy bought while out) with an
  optional note that lands in the ledger and metrics.

**Code:** `ChoreWidget.jsx`, `ChoreSchedulesTab.jsx`, `ChoreHistoryTab.jsx`,
`utils/choreHelpers.js`; backend chore routes + `dailyBackgroundProcessing()` in
`server/index.js`.

### Chore due-time sounds

A schedule can carry a **due time** (`HH:MM`) and play a **notification sound** on
the display when that time arrives. Configured per chore in the schedule editor
(due-time picker, "play sound when due" toggle, a previewable sound picker, and an
optional follow-up **reminder interval** that repeats until the chore is completed).

- **Sound bank:** short, self-authored WAV tones ship as defaults and are seeded into
  `uploads/sounds/`; users can **upload their own** sounds (`.mp3/.wav/.ogg/...`) via
  the picker. Managed through `/api/sounds*` and served from `/Uploads/sounds/`.
- **Layered gating** — all three must be on for a chore to ring:
  1. **Global master** (`CHORE_SOUND_ENABLED`) in Admin → Chores + a default sound and volume.
  2. **Per-device mute** — the 🔔/🔕 button on the chore widget (stored in
     `choreWidgetSettings.soundEnabled` in device settings) silences one display.
  3. **Per-schedule** `sound_enabled` + `due_time`.
- **The ringer** runs app-level (`useChoreSoundScheduler`), so it fires regardless of
  which tab is showing. It rings once at the due time if the chore is still incomplete
  (repeating at the reminder interval until done), primes already-past due times on
  load so it doesn't blast missed alerts, and de-dupes via `localStorage`. Browser
  autoplay is unlocked on the first user interaction.

**Code:** `hooks/useChoreSoundScheduler.js`, `utils/choreSound.js`,
`components/SoundPicker.jsx`; the sound fields on `chore_schedules`; `/api/sounds*` +
seeding in `server/index.js`; defaults generated by `server/scripts/generateDefaultSounds.js`.

### Chore due-dates (issue #97)

A schedule can carry a **calendar due date** (`due_date`, `YYYY-MM-DD`) — a deadline,
distinct from the due-*time* chime above. It's aimed at **one-off chores** (which already
persist on the list until completed), e.g. "prep the guest sheets by Friday." The chore row
colors by urgency: **yellow** when due today, **red** (with an "⚠️ Overdue" chip) once past
due, and a plain "Due &lt;date&gt;" chip while upcoming. Completing the chore clears the
coloring. Purely visual — `due_date` does not change which chores appear.

**Code:** `getDueDateStatus`/`formatDueDate` in `utils/choreHelpers.js`; row coloring + chip
in `ChoreWidget.jsx`; the `due_date` field in `ChoreSchedulesTab.jsx`; `due_date` column and
validation in `server/index.js`.

### Reassigning a chore (from the dashboard)

Each chore row has a **swap-arrow** button (when more than one user exists) that opens a
dropdown to move the chore to another person without opening settings. The backend
reassignment (a `PATCH` of the schedule's `user_id`) re-checks the daily "all regular chores
done" bonus for **both** the previous and new owner and never removes points.

**Code:** reassign UI in `ChoreWidget.jsx`; `PATCH /api/chore-schedules/:id` +
`awardDailyRegularBonusIfDue` in `server/index.js`.

### Metrics-ready history (issue #72)

Every `chore_history` row carries a **`kind`** (`completion`, `daily_bonus`,
`transfer_bonus`, `adjustment`, `missed`, `spent`), which makes reporting
computable:

- The nightly job **logs missed chores** (due-but-uncompleted regular chores get
  a zero-value `missed` row, before pruning) → completion/missed rates.
- **Spending is non-destructive**: reducing clams inserts a negative `spent`
  ledger row instead of deleting earned history, so "earned over time" never
  shrinks retroactively. Balances stay `SUM(clam_value)`.
- The metrics UI itself is the **Chore Metrics plugin** — stat tiles, streaks,
  an activity heatmap, top chores, and earned-vs-spent — built on the plugin
  platform rather than core and published via
  [jherforth/HomeGlowPlugins](https://github.com/jherforth/HomeGlowPlugins)
  (installable from the Admin Panel's GitHub tab).

**Code:** `schema20-choreHistoryKind.js`; missed logging in
`dailyBackgroundProcessing`; `kind` handling throughout the chore/clam routes
in `server/index.js`.

## Routines

A **routine** is a named, ordered checklist a child works through — for example,
"School day start": make bed, brush teeth, get dressed, pack backpack. Routines
sit **beside** chores and are not built from them: they are scheduled like a
calendar entry (days of the week, optional start/end time), completed by ticking
every step, and rewarded through streaks (`streak_bonus_every` completions grant
`streak_bonus_clams` clams).

- **Steps are shared library entries**: the same step (e.g. "brush teeth") can
  appear in more than one routine. Editing a step in the editor changes it
  everywhere it is used — the step editor surfaces the current usage count
  before saving so the fan-out is never silent.
- **Cross-namespace autocomplete**: naming a step suggests titles from both the
  existing step library and the existing chore library (via `GET /api/task-titles`).
  Suggestions only — duplicates are never blocked. This is the agreed mitigation
  for the same real-world task drifting into two spellings across the two name
  spaces.
- **Icons** come from the shared `CHORE_ICON_GROUPS` bank in
  `utils/choreIcons.js`; the emoji character is persisted directly, so a routine
  or a step can outlive any single revision of the bank.
- **Templates** (client-side only) — three ready-made starting points: *School
  day start*, *Bedtime*, *After school*. Picking a template pre-fills the editor
  with a name, icon and ordered steps; the user then chooses the child and
  schedule and saves. The server never learns templates exist — everything routes
  through the same `POST /api/routines` and `POST /api/routines/:id/steps`
  endpoints an editor uses when building one from scratch.

The editor lives in **Admin Panel → Chores → Routines** (a fourth sub-tab
alongside Chores, History, Settings — not a ninth top-level admin tab, since
those already overflow on narrow screens).

**Code:** `components/RoutinesTab.jsx`, `utils/routineTemplates.js` (+ its
tests); the routines/steps/task-titles routes in `server/index.js`.

## Calendar

- Supports multiple sources simultaneously: **public ICS** links, **CalDAV**
  (with credentials), and **Google Calendar** (OAuth).
- A background **Calendar Sync Service** fetches each source on an interval and
  caches events in `calendar_events_cache`; the widget reads the cache, so the UI
  stays fast and works offline between syncs.
- Handles all-day and multi-day events; month and week views. When the month
  view starts on a fixed weekday, an optional **"Start calendar with current
  week"** mode (issue #127) anchors the grid to the current week and shows a
  configurable 1–8 weeks (default 4) instead of the padded calendar month.
- **Cross-calendar dedup**: the same real-world event synced from several
  sources is merged at read time (fuzzy title + time-tolerance match in
  `server/utils/calendarDedup.js`). In the day view, the merged event's bullet
  becomes a **pie of the calendars' colors** (winning calendar first, up to
  four wedges) with a tooltip naming them (issue #125). The bullet always uses
  calendar colors, so it keeps answering "which calendars is this on?"
- **Per-event Google colors** (PR #133): an event individually recolored in
  Google keeps that color in HomeGlow instead of inheriting its calendar's.
  Sync resolves the event's `colorId` to a hex through Google's `/colors`
  palette (cached 24h) and stores it in the existing `raw_data` column, which
  `getCachedEvents` surfaces as `event_color`. Every view prefers
  `event_color` and falls back to `source_color`, so events left on a
  calendar's default color — and all non-Google sources — look exactly as
  before. No schema migration.
- Credentials are encrypted at rest.

**Code:** `CalendarWidget.jsx`, `MonthDayCell.jsx`; backend
`services/calendarSync.js`, `services/appleCalDAV.js`, `services/googleCalendar.js`,
and the `calendar-sources` / `calendar-sync` / `calendar-events` routes.

## Photos

Three source types feed one photo widget:

- **Immich** — self-hosted photo server (API key + album); images streamed via
  `/api/photo-proxy`.
- **Google Photos** — via OAuth + the Photos **Picker** flow; picked media is
  downloaded locally (`google_picked_media`).
- **HomeGlow uploads** — images uploaded directly (including from a phone via the
  `/photos` page), stored in `homeglow_photos` + `server/uploads/`.

**Code:** `PhotoWidget.jsx`, `pages/PhotosUpload.jsx`; backend `services/googlePhotos*.js`
and the `photo-sources` / `photo-items` routes.

## Weather

- Current conditions + 3-day forecast with interactive temperature and
  precipitation graphs.
- **Two sources** (issue #57), chosen in Admin Panel → Connections:
  **OpenWeatherMap** (free API key, location by city/zip/coords) or
  **Home Assistant** (reads an existing `weather.*` entity, no API key needed).
- Fetched **server-side**. Credentials stay on the server, and one upstream call
  is cached for every display rather than each tab fetching its own.

### What Home Assistant can and cannot supply

Home Assistant weather entities vary by integration, so the widget hides what is
missing rather than rendering blanks:

| Field | Home Assistant source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| temperature, humidity, wind | entity attributes | converted from HA's configured unit system |
| feels like | `apparent_temperature` | **not standard** — the row hides when absent |
| condition + icon | entity state | a fixed vocabulary shared with OpenWeatherMap |
| 3-day + hourly forecast | `weather.get_forecasts` service | falls back to the legacy `forecast` attribute on pre-2024 instances |
| **air quality** | — | **unavailable**; the AQI panel hides entirely |

Condition text is translated by HomeGlow from that shared vocabulary, so
forecasts read correctly in every supported language. OpenWeatherMap's own
localized description is preferred where it exists.

**Auto dark mode** no longer needs a weather provider at all: sunrise and sunset
are computed from coordinates (`GET /api/sun`), so the theme switches on schedule
with Home Assistant, with OpenWeatherMap, or with nothing configured.

**Code:** `WeatherWidget.jsx`; `server/services/weather/` (`payload.js` defines
the shared contract, one module per provider, `sun.js` for the solar
calculation); `server/services/homeAssistant.js` for the connection.

## Screensaver (burn-in prevention)

- After a configurable idle timeout, an overlay activates in one of two modes:
  cycling through tabs, or a photo slideshow. Optionally goes full-screen.
- Not mounted on mobile (phones lock themselves; see
  [Mobile Experience](../architecture/mobile-experience.md)).

**Code:** `ScreenSaver.jsx`, `ScreensaverCountdown.jsx`, timer logic in `app.jsx`.

## Vacation mode

- A per-display toggle (Admin Panel → Interface, issue #121) for when the family
  is away: chore due-time chimes are muted and the screensaver becomes a playful
  vacation animation — vacation emoji pop up from behind the dock like popcorn
  and fall back out of view. A subtle 🏖️ badge shows top-right while active.
- Stored in `localStorage` (`vacationModeSettings`) alongside the screensaver
  settings; the mute can be toggled independently of the screensaver swap.
- **Optional date range**: start/end pickers appear when enabled. A bounded
  vacation activates and **auto-expires** on its own (chimes, badge, and the
  vacation screensaver all key off "active today", not just the toggle).
- **Metrics-aware** (issue #72): saving also writes a household-wide
  `vacation_mode` server setting. While active, the nightly job **skips
  missed-chore logging** (days off never count against completion rates) and
  the Chore Metrics plugin treats vacation days as neutral, **bridging
  streaks** across them. Date-bounded vacations bridge past gaps permanently;
  the plain toggle protects streaks while it stays on.

**Code:** `VacationScreensaver.jsx`, settings in `utils/interfaceSettings.js`,
gates in `app.jsx` (sound scheduler + screensaver render), UI in `AdminPanel.jsx`.

## Custom widgets (plugins)

- Upload self-contained HTML widgets through the Admin Panel, or install from the
  `HomeGlowPlugins` GitHub repo. They render in sandboxed iframes, receive the
  theme via URL params, and can share the app stylesheet.
- See the dedicated [Custom Widget Development](../guides/custom-widgets.md) guide.

**Code:** `PluginWidgetWrapper.jsx`, backend `/api/widgets*` routes, and
[`server/widgets/README.md`](../../server/widgets/README.md).

## Admin Panel & PIN

- The gear icon opens `AdminPanel.jsx`, the single place to configure everything
  above.
- Access can be gated by an optional **PIN** (on-screen pad or keyboard entry),
  hashed in the `admin_pin` table.
- **User display order** (issue #134): the Users tab controls what order family
  members appear in — drag a row on desktop, or use the up/down arrows, which
  are the primary control on touch screens since HTML5 drag events never fire
  there (tab reordering works the same way). The order is stored on the user
  (`sort_order`) and applied by `GET /api/users`, so the dashboard chore
  columns, assignment dropdowns, and transfer/split pickers all follow it.
  The `bonus` pseudo-user is pinned.
- **Default avatars** (issue #132): besides uploading a photo, users can pick
  from a built-in bank of flat SVG avatars — mom/dad/girl/boy in five skin
  tones plus fun characters (cat, dog, fish, alpaca, chicken, dino, robot,
  unicorn, frog). Bundled in `server/assets/avatars/` (regenerable via
  `server/scripts/generateDefaultAvatars.js`), seeded into
  `uploads/users/defaults/` at startup, and picked via the "Choose" buttons in
  User Management.

**Code:** `AdminPanel.jsx`, `PinModal.jsx`, backend `/api/admin-pin*` routes.
