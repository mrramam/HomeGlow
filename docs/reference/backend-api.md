# Backend Reference

The backend is a **Fastify 5** server whose routes all live in a single file,
[`server/index.js`](../../server/index.js) (~4,200 lines). Supporting logic is
factored into `services/` and `utils/`. This page maps out the structure and the
full REST surface so you can navigate quickly.

```

## Server lifecycle (`start()` in `index.js`)

1. Connect to / create the SQLite database (`ConnectOrCreateDb`).
2. Run legacy bootstrap migrations if the DB is fresh, then apply any pending
   numbered schema migrations.
3. Start the **nightly cron job** (midnight, local `TZ`) unless
   `HOMEGLOW_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_JOBS=1`.
4. Ensure `uploads/` and `uploads/users/` directories exist.
5. Start the **Calendar Sync Service** unless `HOMEGLOW_DISABLE_CALENDAR_SYNC=1`.
6. Warn if the encryption key is unavailable (disables third-party connections).
7. Listen on `PORT` (default 5000), host `0.0.0.0`.

## Cross-cutting behavior

- **CORS**: wide open (`origin: '*'`) — intended for LAN/kiosk use. Methods
  include `PATCH`. Tighten this if you expose the backend.
- **Multipart uploads**: 25 MB/file, up to 50 files (`@fastify/multipart`).
- **Request logging**: a `preHandler` hook logs every incoming request.
- **Conditional caching**: several device endpoints use ETag-based `304` handling
  via `sendJsonWithConditionalCache`.
- **Static serving**: `/Uploads/`, `/Uploads/users/`, and `/widgets/` are served
  from disk. `/widgets/:filename` additionally rewrites hardcoded ports and injects
  an overflow-fix `<style>` before serving widget HTML.

## Background jobs

### Nightly chore processing (`dailyBackgroundProcessing`)
Runs at local midnight and also exposed manually via
`GET /api/system/backgroundTasks`. It:
- **Logs missed chores first** (issue #72): for each user, yesterday's
  due-but-uncompleted regular chores get an idempotent
  `chore_history` row with `kind='missed'` — before any pruning below can
  delete their schedules. Retroactively completing a chore deletes its
  missed row. **Paused entirely while household vacation mode is active**
  (the `vacation_mode` settings key, written by the Admin Panel's vacation
  save — days off never count as missed).
- Prunes completed one-time chore schedules (completion = a
  `kind='completion'` row; a missed row never counts) and orphaned chores.
- Resets day-to-day **bonus** chores back to unassigned.
- Generates one-time child instances for `until-completed` / `once-completed`
  "sticky" schedules whose cron fires that day (using `cron-parser`).

### Calendar sync service
[`services/calendarSync.js`](../../server/services/calendarSync.js) maintains a
per-source interval timer, fetches events (ICS via `node-ical`, CalDAV via
`appleCalDAV`, Google via `googleCalendar`), normalizes all-day/multi-day events,
and upserts them into `calendar_events_cache`, updating `calendar_sync_status`.

### Google API client pattern
All three Google service files (`googleCalendar.js`, `googlePhotos.js`,
`googlePhotosPicker.js`) share a common authenticated fetch pattern provided by
`googleConnection.createGoogleFetch(apiBase, serviceLabel)`. This factory returns
a configured `googleFetch(db, accountId, method, pathAndQuery, body)` that handles:
access token retrieval, URL construction, Bearer auth, JSON parsing, 204 responses,
and structured error objects (`{ message, status, details }`). Each service
file instantiates its own copy with the appropriate API base URL and label.

## REST API surface

All application endpoints are under `/api`. The frontend reaches them through the
Nginx `/api` proxy. Endpoints marked _device-scoped_ take a `:deviceName` path
segment (the browser's `localStorage` UUID).

### System / meta
| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/test` | Health check. |
| GET | `/api/stats` | Backend version, git commit, repo, commit URL. |
| GET | `/api/timezone` | Server timezone. |
| GET | `/api/system/backgroundTasks` | Manually trigger nightly processing. |
| GET | `/index.css` | Serves the app CSS for custom widgets (with fallback). |

### Custom widgets / plugins
| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/widgets/upload` | Upload an HTML widget. |
| GET | `/api/widgets` | List installed widgets (registry). |
| DELETE | `/api/widgets/:filename` | Delete a widget. |
| GET | `/api/widgets/debug` | Inspect the widgets directory + registry. |
| GET | `/api/widgets/github` | List widgets available in the `HomeGlowPlugins` GitHub repo. |
| POST | `/api/widgets/github/install` | Install a widget from GitHub. |
| GET | `/widgets/:filename` | Serve a widget's HTML (theme-aware, sandboxed). |
| GET | `/plugin-sdk/v1.js` | Serve the plugin SDK (`window.HomeGlow`) loaded by manifest plugins. |

### Plugin platform API (`/api/plugin/v1`)
The **stable, versioned contract** that manifest plugins may rely on (issue #105).
Unlike the rest of this surface, these routes are frozen — a breaking change means
a new `vN`. Storage/settings mutations are namespaced per plugin and are *not*
blocked in demo mode. See the [Plugin Development guide](../guides/plugin-development.md)
for the developer-facing detail and the `HomeGlow.*` SDK wrappers.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/plugin/v1/storage/:pluginId` | All key/value docs for the plugin. |
| GET | `/api/plugin/v1/storage/:pluginId/:key` | One stored value (404 if absent). |
| PUT | `/api/plugin/v1/storage/:pluginId/:key` | Upsert a JSON value (64 KB / 500-key caps). |
| DELETE | `/api/plugin/v1/storage/:pluginId/:key` | Delete a key. |
| POST | `/api/plugin/v1/storage/:pluginId/:key/increment` | Atomic `{ path, delta }` numeric increment. |
| GET | `/api/plugin/v1/settings/:pluginId` | Effective declared settings (`?device=` for device scope). |
| PUT | `/api/plugin/v1/settings/:pluginId` | Write declared settings (validated against the manifest). |
| GET | `/api/plugin/v1/events/stream` | SSE stream of core events (`clam.*`, `chore.*`). |

### Chore notification sounds
| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/sounds` | List available sounds (bundled defaults + uploads); each has `filename`, `url` (`/Uploads/sounds/<file>`), `isDefault`. |
| POST | `/api/sounds/upload` | Upload a custom sound (`.mp3/.wav/.ogg/.m4a/.aac`). |
| DELETE | `/api/sounds/:filename` | Delete an uploaded sound (bundled defaults are protected). |

Default sounds ship in `server/assets/sounds/` and are seeded into
`uploads/sounds/` on startup; all sounds are served via the existing `/Uploads/`
static route.

### Devices, tabs & layout (device-scoped)
| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/devices` | List devices with widget counts. |
| GET/PUT/PATCH | `/api/devices/:deviceName/settings` | Get/merge device settings JSON. |
| PATCH | `/api/devices/:deviceName` | Rename a device. |
| POST | `/api/devices/:deviceName/copy-from/:sourceDeviceName` | Copy tabs + settings from another device. |
| DELETE | `/api/devices/:deviceName` | Delete a device (cascades tabs). |
| GET/POST | `/api/devices/:deviceName/tabs` | List / create tabs. |
| PATCH | `/api/devices/:deviceName/tabs/:tabNumber` | Update a tab. |
| PATCH | `/api/devices/:deviceName/tabs/reorder` | Reorder tabs. |
| DELETE | `/api/devices/:deviceName/tabs/:tabNumber` | Delete a tab (widgets fall back to Home). |

| DELETE | `/api/devices/:deviceName/widget-assignments/widget/:widgetName` | Remove all assignments for a widget. |
| PATCH | `/api/devices/:deviceName/widget-assignments/layout` | Update one widget's grid layout. |
| PATCH | `/api/devices/:deviceName/widget-assignments/layout/bulk` | Bulk layout update (drag/resize save). |

### Chores, schedules & history
| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET/POST | `/api/chores` | List / create chore definitions. |
| PATCH/DELETE | `/api/chores/:id` | Update / delete a chore. |
| GET/POST | `/api/chore-schedules` | List (filter by `user_id`, `visible`, `usage`, `chore_id`) / create. Accepts `due_time` (`HH:MM`), `sound`, `sound_enabled`, `reminder_interval_minutes` for due-time sounds, and `due_date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) for calendar deadlines. PATCH `user_id` reassigns a chore and re-checks the daily bonus for both owners. |
| GET/PATCH/DELETE | `/api/chore-schedules/:id` | Single schedule CRUD. |
| POST | `/api/chore-schedules/bulk` | Bulk create schedules. |
| GET/POST | `/api/chore-history` | Query / add history entries. |

| GET | `/api/chore-history/summary/:userId` | Summary/aggregate for a user. |
| GET | `/api/chore-history/recent` | Recent (last 7 days) completions. |
| DELETE | `/api/chore-history/:id` | Delete a history entry. |
| POST | `/api/chores/complete` | Mark a chore complete (awards clams / daily bonus). |
| POST | `/api/chores/uncomplete` | Undo a completion. |

### Routines, steps & occurrences

Routines are a checklist-style scheduled task that lives beside chores
(never built from them). Completing every step of a routine writes one
append-only `chore_history` row (`kind='routine'`, `clam_value=0`); when
the consecutive-scheduled-occurrence streak hits a bonus multiple, an
additional `kind='streak'` row awards clams. See
[`docs/architecture/database.md`](../architecture/database.md#routines).

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/routines` | List routines with their ordered steps. Optional `?user_id=` and `?visible=` filters. |
| POST | `/api/routines` | Create a routine: `{name, user_id?, icon?, visible?, crontab, start_time?, end_time?, streak_bonus_every?, streak_bonus_clams?}`. |
| GET | `/api/routines/:id` | Single routine + steps. |
| PATCH | `/api/routines/:id` | Update fields. Persisted streak is not recomputed against the new schedule. |
| DELETE | `/api/routines/:id` | Delete a routine (cascades `routine_steps` and `routine_progress`). |
| POST | `/api/routines/:id/steps` | Add a step: `{step_id}` to attach an existing step, or `{title, icon?}` to create + attach. Optional `position`. |
| PATCH | `/api/routines/:id/steps/reorder` | Reorder: `{orderedStepIds: [id, …]}` must list every current step exactly once. |
| DELETE | `/api/routines/:id/steps/:stepId` | Remove step from routine. |
| GET | `/api/steps` | List the shared step library. |
| POST | `/api/steps` | Create a step: `{title, icon?}`. |
| PATCH/DELETE | `/api/steps/:id` | Update / delete a shared step (delete cascades removals from routines). |
| POST | `/api/routines/:routineId/steps/:stepId/tick` | Mark a step done today: `{user_id?}`. Idempotent (a re-tap is a no-op). When every step is done, records one `chore_history` row and advances the streak; awards a streak bonus when applicable. Rejects dates other than today. |
| DELETE | `/api/routines/:routineId/steps/:stepId/tick` | Untick a step for today (`?date=` optional, must be today). Never retracts a recorded completion or its clams. |
| GET | `/api/routines/:id/progress` | Today's tick state (`?date=` overrideable): `{ticked_step_ids, total_steps, done_steps, complete, recorded_completion, current_streak, last_completion_date}`. |
| GET | `/api/routine-occurrences` | Synth calendar-shape occurrences for a range: `?start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD` (`?user_id=` optional). Returns `[{user_id, summary, start, end, all_day, source: 'routine', routine_id, icon, date}]` sorted by start. |
| GET | `/api/task-titles` | Cross-namespace autocomplete: `[{title, icon, source: 'step'\|'chore'}]` merged from `steps` and `chores`, sorted by title. |

### Users & clams
| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET/POST | `/api/users` | List / create users. Listed in admin-chosen display order (`sort_order`, then `id`); new users append at the end. |
| PATCH | `/api/users/reorder` | Set the display order: `{ orderedUserIds: [id, …] }` must list every reorderable user exactly once (the `bonus` pseudo-user is pinned and excluded). |
| PATCH/DELETE | `/api/users/:id` | Update / delete a user. |
| POST | `/api/users/:id/upload-picture` | Upload an avatar. |
| GET | `/api/avatars/defaults` | List the built-in default avatar bank (people in five skin tones + fun characters). |
| POST | `/api/users/:id/avatar` | Set a built-in avatar as the profile picture (`{ filename: 'defaults/<name>.svg' }`). |
| GET | `/api/users/:id/clams` | Current clam balance. |
| POST | `/api/users/:id/clams/add` | Add clams (admin adjustment). |
| POST | `/api/users/:id/clams/reduce` | Reduce clams (e.g. prize purchase) — inserts a negative `kind='spent'` ledger row (non-destructive; optional body `kind: 'adjustment'` for corrections). |

### Prizes & the prize store
| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET/POST | `/api/prizes` | List / create prize definitions (the ledger). Optional `repeatable: true` — the offer returns to the shelf after each redemption. |
| PATCH/DELETE | `/api/prizes/:id` | Update / delete a prize definition (PATCH accepts optional `repeatable`). |
| GET/POST | `/api/prize-offers` | List store offers / place a ledger prize in the store. |
| DELETE | `/api/prize-offers/:id` | Remove an unredeemed offer from the store. |
| POST | `/api/prize-offers/:id/request` | Kid requests an available offer (`{ user_id }`). Optional `split_user_ids: [id, …]` names co-spenders sharing the cost. |
| POST | `/api/prize-offers/:id/cancel-request` | Withdraw a pending request (clears any split). |
| POST | `/api/prize-offers/:id/decline` | Parent declines; offer returns to the shelf. |
| POST | `/api/prize-offers/:id/approve` | Parent approves: each participant pays `floor(cost / participants)` as a `spent` ledger row (an uneven remainder is silently discounted), the offer is consumed (or returned to the shelf if repeatable), emits `clam.withdrawn` per participant + one `prize.redeemed`. |

### Settings & API keys
| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET/POST | `/api/settings` | Read / write global settings (ICS URL, chore sounds, …). |
| POST | `/api/settings/search` | Look up specific settings. |
| POST | `/api/test-api-key` | Validate an OpenWeatherMap key. |
| GET | `/api/proxy` | Generic CORS proxy (used by widgets/integrations). |

> **Secrets are redacted from both read routes.** `GET /api/settings` and
> `POST /api/settings/search` are unauthenticated and return the whole settings
> table, so `WEATHER_API_KEY`, `HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN_ENC`, and
> `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET_ENC` are filtered out server-side
> (`REDACTED_SETTING_KEYS` in `index.js`). The Admin Panel edits them blind —
> writing an **empty value** to a redacted key is treated as "leave unchanged"
> so saving an untouched form cannot wipe a stored credential. Whether one is
> stored is reported by the `/api/connections/*/status` routes.

### Weather
Weather is fetched **server-side** so provider credentials never reach a browser
(issue #57). The active provider is the `WEATHER_PROVIDER` setting
(`openweathermap` | `homeassistant`); demo mode always uses the bundled snapshot.
Every provider returns the same payload — see
`server/services/weather/payload.js`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/weather` | Current conditions, 3-day forecast, hourly series, air quality. Params: `location` or `lat`+`lon`, `units` (`imperial`\|`metric`), `lang`, `refresh=1`. |
| GET | `/api/weather/geocode` | Resolve a free-text location to `{lat, lon, resolvedName}`. With **no** `q`, returns Home Assistant's own configured location when that is the provider. |
| GET | `/api/sun` | `{sunrise, sunset, alwaysUp, alwaysDown}` (unix seconds) computed from `lat`/`lon`. No provider or API key involved — auto dark mode works with nothing configured. |

Responses are cached for 10 minutes per (provider, location, units, language),
so one upstream call serves every display in the house rather than one per tab
per device. Provider failures map to `401` (bad credentials), `404` (unknown
location), `503`/`504` (unreachable), and `502` (provider returned a payload
that failed contract validation).

### Calendar sources, events & sync
| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET/POST | `/api/calendar` | Legacy calendar settings. |
| GET | `/api/calendar/ics` | Export/serve an ICS feed. |
| GET/POST | `/api/calendar-sources` | List / create calendar sources. |
| PATCH/DELETE | `/api/calendar-sources/:id` | Update / delete a source. |
| POST | `/api/calendar-sources/:id/test` | Test connectivity to a source. |
| POST | `/api/calendar-sources/:id/events` | Add an event to a (writable) source. |
| PATCH/DELETE | `/api/calendar-sources/:id/events/:eventId` | Edit / delete an event. |
| GET | `/api/calendar-events` | Read cached events for the widget. |
| GET | `/api/calendar-sync/status` | Overall sync status. |
| GET | `/api/calendar-sync/status/:sourceId` | Per-source status. |
| POST | `/api/calendar-sync/:sourceId` | Force sync one source. |
| POST | `/api/calendar-sync/all` | Force sync all sources. |
| GET/PATCH | `/api/calendar-sync/:sourceId/interval` | Get / set sync interval. |

### Google & Apple connections
| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/connections/google/status` | Linked-account status. |
| POST | `/api/connections/google/config` | Store OAuth client config. |
| GET | `/api/connections/google/authorize` | Begin OAuth. |
| GET | `/api/connections/google/callback` | OAuth redirect handler. |
| GET | `/api/connections/google/albums` | List Google Photos albums. |
| GET | `/api/connections/google/calendars` | List Google calendars. |
| DELETE | `/api/connections/google/account` | Unlink Google account. |
| POST | `/api/connections/apple/calendars` | List Apple/CalDAV calendars. |

### Home Assistant connection
Home Assistant's long-lived access token controls the whole house, so it is
encrypted at rest, redacted from the settings routes, and only ever used
server-side.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/connections/homeassistant/status` | `{has_url, has_token, url, weather_entity, encryption}` — never the token. |
| PUT | `/api/connections/homeassistant` | Save URL / token / weather entity. An omitted or empty `token` keeps the stored one. Rejects non-http(s) URLs with 400. |
| POST | `/api/connections/homeassistant/test` | `{ok, message, version}` — health check against `GET /api/`. |
| GET | `/api/connections/homeassistant/weather-entities` | List `weather.*` entities for the Admin Panel picker. |
| DELETE | `/api/connections/homeassistant` | Clear the stored connection. |
| GET | `/api/connections/weather/status` | Active provider, whether it is usable, and why not if it isn't. |

### Photo sources & media
| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET/POST | `/api/photo-sources` | List / create photo sources. |
| PATCH/DELETE | `/api/photo-sources/:id` | Update / delete a source. |
| POST | `/api/photo-sources/:id/test` | Test connectivity. |
| GET | `/api/photo-proxy/:sourceId/:assetId` | Proxy/stream a remote asset (e.g. Immich). |

| DELETE | `/api/photo-sources/:sourceId/uploaded/:photoId` | Delete an uploaded photo. |
| GET | `/api/photo-sources/:sourceId/picked` | List Google-picked media. |
| GET | `/api/photo-sources/:sourceId/picked/:mediaRowId` | Serve one picked media file. |
| DELETE | `/api/photo-sources/:sourceId/picked/:mediaRowId` | Delete picked media. |
| POST/GET/DELETE | `/api/photo-sources/:sourceId/picker-session` | Manage a Google Photos Picker session. |
| POST | `/api/photo-sources/:sourceId/picker-session/ingest` | Download picked items locally. |
| GET | `/api/photo-items` | Aggregated photo feed for the widget. |

### Admin PIN
| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/admin-pin/exists` | Whether a PIN is set. |
| POST | `/api/admin-pin/set` | Set/replace the PIN. |
| DELETE | `/api/admin-pin` | Remove the PIN. |
| POST | `/api/admin-pin/verify` | Verify an entered PIN. |

## Tests

The backend uses the built-in Node test runner. Suites live in `server/tests/`
(`apiEndpoints.test.js`, `calendarSync.test.js`, `encryption.test.js`,
`googleCalendar.test.js`) and are driven by
[`runServerTests.js`](../../server/tests/runServerTests.js), which cleans up
temp artifacts before/after. Run with:

```bash
cd server
npm test            # or: npm run test-debug  (keeps artifacts)
npm run test:coverage
```
